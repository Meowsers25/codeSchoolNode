Now install the coffee-script module, but install it globally
so you can use the coffee executable that comes with coffee-script.

$ npm install coffee-script -g

npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/coffee-script
npm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/coffee-script
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/coffee-script/-/coffee-script-1.8.0.tgz
npm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/coffee-script/-/coffee-script-1.8.0.tgz
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/mkdirp
npm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/mkdirp
coffee-script@1.8.0 /node_modules/coffee-script
└── mkdirp@0.3.5
Congratulations, you're correct!
